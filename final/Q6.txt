// Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last name, 
// first name and student_id, are too slow (we can't do enough of them per second from our program). 
// What could potentially improve the speed of inserts? Check all that apply.

// No, updating the index slows down writes.
Add an index on last_name, first_name if one does not already exist.

// Yes, this means the write doens't have to update indexes which makes it faster
Remove all indexes from the collection, leaving only the index on _id in place

// No such thing
Provide a hint to MongoDB that it should not use an index for the inserts

// Yes, because this will do a fire-and-forget in memory write that returns immediately,
// isn't verified and doesn't wait for data to be replicated to the journal
Set w=0, j=0 on writes

// You can only write to the primary and writes must replicate anyway
// Reading from secondaries would help performance, not writing.
Build a replica set and insert data into the secondary nodes to free up the primary nodes.
