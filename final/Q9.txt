We need to decide on a shard key to shard the record collection. What's the best shard key for the record collection, provided that we are willing to run inefficient scatter-gather operations to do infrequent research and run studies on various diseases and cohorts? That is, think mostly about the operational aspects of such a system. And by operational, we mean, think about what the most common operations that this systems needs to perform day in and day out.

// Well, day in and day out operations will likely be on single patients, modifying their records.
// For these queries the best shard key would keep all records related to a single patient on the same shard.
// That way most queries can be resolved by mongos using a single shared and no inefficient scatter-gather

// No. Monotonically increasing, creates hotspotting, all write traffic will be handled by a single node
// For all people in the US?  Not likely.
Date and time when medical record was created

// No, isn't this stored in the patient collection? 
// Probably not enough cardinality, hotspotting with common last names.
Patient last name

// Possibly, this would group records for each patient on a single shard to distribute the load. 
// Also, doesn't change.
patient_id

// No, the _id for each record is essentially random.  A common query to pull a single patient's records
// would be scatter gather.
_id

// No, isn't this stored in the patient collection? 
// Probably not enough cardinality, hotspotting with common names.
Patient first name

// No. This can change, and it is difficult to change shard key after the fact.
