Now suppose you want to run the following query against the collection.
db.stuff.find({'a':{'$lt':10000}, 'b':{'$gt': 5000}}, {'a':1, 'c':1}).sort({'c':-1})
Which of the indexes could be used by MongoDB to assist in answering the query? Check all that apply.

// Note: the second parameter to find () is a projection and has no bearing on indexes used.

// Yes, a and b for their respective range queries, then pull the c records in sorted order
a_1_b_1_c_-1

// Yes, for the range queries only.
a_1_b_1

// No, we're not doing queries on ID
_id_

// Partially.  Could use only the a portion of the query to help.
a_1_c_1

// Yes, for sorting the result.
c_1
